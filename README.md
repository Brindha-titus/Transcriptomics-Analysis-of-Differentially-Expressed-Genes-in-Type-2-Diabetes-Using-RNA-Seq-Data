This project combines biology and data science to explore how gene expression differs in people with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Using RNA-Seq data from the GSE164416 dataset, the workflow performs data cleaning, normalization, and statistical analysis to identify genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated in diabetic samples. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and heatmaps reveal clear separation between diabetic and normal tissues, while ROC curves evaluate the accuracy of key biomarker genes. The goal is to turn complex genomic data into meaningful biological insight â€” showing how computational tools can help decode disease mechanisms and support precision medicine.
